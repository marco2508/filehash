This repository contains:
- the RMD file with the code to execute the six different tasks
- the HTML as generated by pressing the Knit button in RStudio
- this readme.md file
- the activity.zip file that contains the data
- the DOC folder with instructions that I downloaded from the repository from Roger D Peng

It does not contain figures because I did not plot the figures to files!
